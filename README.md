# odin-recipes
This is gonna be my first project with Odin Project.
The goal of this project is to test my skills by building a plain html page that has 3 relative links to push it to GitHub from my local machine through Git commit. Every relative link has a food recipe inside it. Here I used paragraphs to write a description then added lists of ingredients and lists.
