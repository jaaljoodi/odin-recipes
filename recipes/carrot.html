  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Delight friends with an afternoon tea that includes this easy carrot cake. You can bake the cake, freeze it and just drizzle over the icing on the day</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>175g light muscovado sugar</li>
    <li>175ml sunflower oil</li>
    <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>140g grated carrots (about 3 medium)</li>
    <li>100g raisins</li>
    <li>grated zest of 1 large orange</li>
    <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>½ tsp grated nutmeg (freshly grated will give you the best flavour)</li>
    <li>175g icing sugar</li>
    <li>1½-2 tbsp orange juice</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/Gas 4/fan 160C. Oil and line the base and sides of an 18cm square cake tin with baking parchment.</li>
    <li>Tip the sugar into a large mixing bowl, pour in the oil and add the eggs. Lightly mix with a wooden spoon. Stir in the grated carrots, raisins and orange rind.</li>
    <li>Mix the flour, bicarbonate of soda and spices, then sift into the bowl. Lightly mix all the ingredients – when everything is evenly amalgamated stop mixing.</li>
    <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 40- 45 minutes, until it feels firm and springy when you press it in the centre. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn it out, peel off the paper and cool on a wire rack.</li>
    <li>Beat together the frosting ingredients in a small bowl until smooth – you want the icing about as runny as single cream. Set the cake on a serving plate and boldly drizzle the icing back and forth in diagonal lines over the top, letting it drip down the sides.</li>
  </ol>
